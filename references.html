            "I teach students who are looking for career changes into technology. I've been a developer for almost 20 years, and ran my own consulting company for nearly 10. Christine (Chrissy) is one of those rare people who pick up on things quickly. She puts in extra effort in everything she does. She's fantastic at helping those around her as well. As time has moved on, I've been helping mentor her and she's shown an amazing aptitude and passion for development. Any organization would be lucky to have her."

Former students, who had her as a teacher in previous years, often sought her out for help in higher level mathematics courses."
