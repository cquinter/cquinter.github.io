            For the past five years, I have been a High School Geometry Teacher.  It was my tradition to begin each school year by writing a program with my students on our calculators.  My goal was to model how to break down a task with profound problem-solving skills while also exposing them to the idea of programming.  Our whole world is immersed in technology, but not many of my students had ever considered what goes on in the background to make an app work.  Before I knew it, I became the touchpoint for students who went on to write their own programs.  Troubleshooting with them on the side turned out to be the most energetic part of my day.  I was trying to inspire them, but I found them inspiring me!  I thought to myself, can I combine these two passions?  So, I decided to take my career in a new direction.  My first step is to learn as much as I can about code.  I am eager and excited to begin this journey!
