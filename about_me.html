            For the past five years, I have been a High School Geometry Teacher.  I began each school year by writing a program with my students on our TI calculators.  My goal was to show the students how to break down a task with profound problem-solving skills.  Once the students saw it working, they were so impressed!  Before I knew it, I became the touchpoint as students went on to write their own programs.  Troubleshooting with them turned out to be the most energetic part of my day.  I was trying to inspire them, but I found them inspiring me!  I thought to myself, I really love teaching, but is programming something I love even more?  So, I decided to make a career change!  I am eager, enthusiastic, and excited for this journey!
